# rPass
Simple Rust-based password generator based on Qwertycards

## How it works

Each rpass password has 4 components:

- A prefix
- A memorable secret
- The name of the service you're generating the password for
- A cipher

The prefix and cipher are randomly generated by rpass. The prefix is between 7 characters long, while the cipher is 512 characters (wow!)

Passwords are assembled by concatenating the prefix, the memorable secret and the service name mapped to the cipher

The memorable secret is the only value that is never stored or seen by rpass This is because the memorable secret is a phrase of your choice and the one and only thing you need to memorise for your passwords!

**Make sure to never share your memorable secret to anyone. This could be used by anyone with access to your device and user account to reverse engineer your passwords**

This ensures that all passwords that are generated by rpass are:

- Unique
- Secure
- Memorable
- Reproducible
- Never wholly stored anywhere on the machine!

Knowing this, you can be sure your passwords are secure.
